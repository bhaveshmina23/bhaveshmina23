<h2>ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Welcome to my profile. </h2>
I'm a driven and detail-oriented <b>Machine Learning & Data Engineering Professional</b> with 2+ years of experience in building intelligent systems, deploying end-to-end data projects, and leveraging advanced analytics to deliver impactful business solutions.
ðŸ’¡ Expertise:<br>
In my journey as a Data & AI practitioner, I have developed deep technical acumen in the following areas:
ðŸ”¹ Programming & Data Analysis: I specialize in Python and its powerful data stackâ€”Pandas, NumPy, and Statisticsâ€”to manipulate, analyze, and model data for meaningful insight generation. My data processing pipelines are both efficient and scalable.
ðŸ”¹ Data Visualization: I turn raw data into compelling narratives using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Bokeh. My dashboards and visual reports are designed to drive clear decision-making across technical and non-technical audiences.
ðŸ”¹ Machine Learning & Deep Learning: From classical ML models to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), I have built and deployed intelligent systems using TensorFlow, Keras, and Scikit-learn. I also apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) and work with Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve text-based challenges.
ðŸ”¹ Web Development & Deployment: I use Flask to develop API-driven web applications and microservices. Iâ€™m experienced in containerization with Docker and deploying robust solutions on AWS Cloud, ensuring scalability and reliability in production environments.
ðŸ”¹ Database & Big Data Technologies: I am proficient in SQL, and have hands-on experience working with NoSQL databases like MongoDB. I understand Big Data systems and am comfortable working with large-scale datasets in distributed computing environments.
ðŸ”¹ End-to-End Project Lifecycle: From data ingestion and preprocessing to model building, evaluation, and deployment, I have executed multiple end-to-end machine learning and data engineering projects, aligning technical solutions with real-world business needs.
